# Using Email

## I. Introduction

E-mail is an electronic system for sending and receiving messages and files over a computer network. Compared to the phone or paper-based documents, e-mail is still relatively new in the workplace. When you are using e-mail, here are a few guidelines to keep in mind:

- **E-mail is increasingly used for professional purposes**--Not long ago, e-mail was considered a secondary form of communication. It was **spontaneous** and chatty, used mostly for quick comments or nonessential information. Today, e-mail is a principal form of communication in most workplaces, so people expect email messages to be professional and **non-frivolous**.

- **E-mail is a form of public communication**--In the past, readers forgave typos, misspellings, and **bloopers** in e-mail messages, especially when e-mail was new and difficult to use. Today, readers expect e-mails to be more formal, reflecting the quality expected in other forms of communication.

- **E-mail standards and conventions are still being formed**--How e-mail should be used in the workspace is still being worked out. People hold widely different views about the appropriate (and inappropriate) use of e-mail. So, you need to pay close attention to how e-mail is used in your company and your readers' companies. Many companies are developing policies explaining on e-mail usage, you should read it and follow it.

You should also keep in mind that legal constraints shape how e-mail is used in the workspace. E-mail, like any other written document, is protected by copyright law. So, you need to be careful not to use e-mails in any way that might **violate** copyright law. For example, if you receive an e-mail from a client, you cannot immediately post it to your company's website without that client's permission.

Also, lawyers and courts treat e-mail as written communication, equivalent to a **memo** ot letter. For example, much of the **antitrust** case against Microsoft in the late 1990s was built on recovered e-mail messages in which Bill Gates and other executives chatted informally about aggressively competing with other companies.

Legally, any e-mail you send via the employer's computer network belongs to the employer. So, your employers are within their rights to read your e-mail without your knowledge or permission. Also deleted e-mails can be retrieved from the company's servers, and they can be used in a legal case.

Increasingly, **harassment** and **discrimination** cases **hinge** on evidence found in e-mails. Careless e-mails about personal relationships or appearances can be saved and used against the sender in a court case. **Indiscreet** comments about gender, race, or **sexual orientation** can also have unexpected consequences. Your "harmless" dirty jokes sent to your coworkers might end up being used by a lawyer to prove that you are creating a "hostile workspace environment."

## II. Basic Features of E-Mail

An email is formatted similarly to a memo. Typical e-mail messages will have a *header* and *body*. They also have additional features like *attachments* and *signatures*.

### 1. Header

The header has lines for *To* and *Subject*. Usually, there are also lines like *cc*, *bcc*, and *Attachments*, which allow you to expand the capabilities of the message.

- **To line**--Here is where you type the e-mail address of the person to whom you are sending the e-mail. You can put multiple addresses on this line, allowing you to send your message to many people.

- **cc and bcc lines**--They are used to copy the message to people who are not the primary readers, like your supervisors or others who might be interested in your conversation. The cc line shows your message's **recipient** that others are receiving copies of the message too. The bcc line ("blind cc") allows you to copy your messages to others without anyone else knowing.

- **Subject line**--It signals the topic of the email. Usually a small phrase is used. If the message is a response to a prior message, e-mail programs usually automatically insert a "Re:" into the subject line. If the message is being forwarded, a "Fwd:" is inserted in the subject line.

- **Attachments line**--It signals whether there are any additional files, pictures, or programs attached to the e-mail message. You can attach whole documents created on your **word processor**, **spreadsheet program**, or **presentation software**. An attached document retains its original formatting and can be downloaded right to the reader's computer.

### 2. Message Area

After the header, the *message area* is where you can type your comments to your readers. It should have a clear introduction, body, and conclusion.

- The *introduction* should minimally (1) define the subject, (2) state your purpose, and (3) state your main point. Also, if you want the reader to do something, you should mention it up front, not at the end of the e-mail.

- The *body* should provide the information needed to prove or support your e-mail's purpose.

- The *conclusion* should restate the main point and look to the future. Most readers of e-mail never reach the conclusion, so you should tell them any action items early in the message and then *restate* them in the conclusion.

The message area might also include these other kinds of text:

- **Reply text**--When you reply to a message, most e-mail programs allow you to copy parts of the original message into your message. These parts are often identified with > arrows running down the left margin.

- **Links**--You can also add in direct links to websites. Most programs will automatically recognize a **webpage** address like "http://www.predatorconservation.org" and make it a live link in the e-mail's message area.

- **Attachments**--If you attach a file to your e-mail message, you should tell the readers in the message area that a file is attached. Otherwise, they may not notice it.

- **Emoticons**--Another common feature in the message area is the use of emoticons. Used **sparingly**, they can help you signal emotions that are hard to convey in written text. When overused, emoticons can become annoying to some readers. In most workplace situations, emoticons should not be used. They are playful and informal; therefore, they are really only appropriate in e-mails between close colleagues or friends.

## 3. Signature

E-mail programs usually let you create a *signature file* that automatically puts a *signature* at the end of your messages. Signature files can be both simple and complex.
